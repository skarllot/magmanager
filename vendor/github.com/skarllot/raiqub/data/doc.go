Package raiqub provides some common tasks for Web Services implementations.

Cache

A Cache provides in-memory key:value cache that expires after defined duration
of time. That duration is defined when a new instance is initialized calling
'raiqub.NewCache()' function and it is used to all cached values.

The Cache can manage an application context. Creating an application context its
the recommended way to avoid global variables and strict the access to your
variables to selected functions.

The lifetime of a value can be modified calling 'SetLifetime()'. The
expiration time of a value is automatically updated when its value is retrieved
by the following methods: 'Get()', 'Set()' and 'SetLifetime()'.
