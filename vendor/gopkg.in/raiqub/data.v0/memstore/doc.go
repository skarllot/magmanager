Package memstore provides in-memory data store implementation.

Store

A Store provides in-memory key:value cache that expires after defined duration
of time. That duration is defined when a new instance is initialized calling
'memstore.New()' function and it is used to all new stored values.

The Store can manage an application context. Creating an application context
its the recommended way to avoid global variables and strict the access to your
variables to selected functions.

The lifetime for new values and/or existing values can be modified calling
'SetLifetime()'. The new expiration time will be automatically updated as
specified by the scope parameter.

The expiration behaviour can be changed calling 'SetTransient()' to define
whether the lifetime of stored value is fixed (transient) or is extended when
it is read or written (non-transient).
