/*
Package crypt provides some cryptographic operations.

RandomAggr

A RandomAggr allows to aggregate random data sources to fill a buffer. Each
source has weight to control the percentage from total to be read.

It implements the io.ReadCloser interface to allow to close sources if needed.

Salter

A Salter provides a random data generator to password salt and unique session
IDs. Every token generated is used to salt next token to increase
unpredictability of generated data.

SSTDEG

A SSTDEG provides a pseudo-random generator based on syscall time deltas of
Sleep calls. It implements io.Reader interface.
